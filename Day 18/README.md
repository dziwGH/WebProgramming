To start, cd into the backend folder and run the command 'nodemon .\serverjs'.
In a different terminal tap, cd into the frontend folder and run 'npm install' followed by 'npm run dev' or 'npm start'.

The app should automatically open in your browser. Happy blog posting!

Some of the new features that were added was a delete post button and an edit post button.
The delete button does as it says, click it and that specific post will be deleted.
If you choose to edit your post, clicking the edit button will change the page to say "Edit your post" and will put your original post back into the text boxes, where you can then edit it. 
You can choose to submit your edited post but clicking the update button or you can cancel the edit by clicking the cancel button
