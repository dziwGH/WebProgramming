# Web Programming Final Project

This is the final project for my Spring 2025 Web Programming class taught by Dr. Bhaskar Ghosh.

## How to set up the Project:

To start, you will need to create a parent directory and add all the files from this GitHub Page. You can call the directory whatever you want. I called it 'my-personal-website'.

## Installations

You will need to install: 
### Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en) 
### MongoDB either [locally](https://www.mongodb.com/products/self-managed/community-edition) or the cloud version [Mongo DB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas).
### VS Code if you have not already [here](https://code.visualstudio.com)

## Project Structure

Your directory structure should look just like it does in this Respository. Inside of the parent directory (my-personal-webpage), you will need a 'backend' and a 'frontend'.

Next, you should open your terminal or command prompt and change directories to the backend by typing: `cd my-personal-webpage/backend`. Of course, if you called your project something else you will need to change the directory name.

Now you should be able to install all the required libraries by using the `npm instal` command.

If you have not already, you should create `.gitignore`



















# React + Vite


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
